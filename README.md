Binding of Isaac: Repentance Mod

Tired of getting crap in every item room you visit?    
Tired of not having enough items to sufficiently kill bosses?   
Do you just want more items? 

Lucky for you (if you choose to install this mod), this is the pick-me-up you've been looking for!

This mod gives you a couple item each floor to keep your run going, although it is currently possible to get something spicy and potentially skew/ruin your run.
Use at your own discretion.

Overall mod is fully functional, but the blacklist feature will be integrated soonâ„¢

Further improvements are coming soon!
