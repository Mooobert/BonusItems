Binding of Isaac: Repentance Mod

Tired of getting crap every run?    
Tired of not having enough items to sufficiently kill bosses?   
Do you just want more items? 

Lucky for you (if you choose to install this mod), this is the pick-me-up you've been looking for!

This mod gives you a couple item each floor to compensate for anything unsavory you might've picked up to keep your run going.

Currently functional, but further improvements are coming soon!
